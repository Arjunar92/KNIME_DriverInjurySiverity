# KNIME_DriverInjurySiverity
Predict Injury siverity of driver using KNIME

### Project Discription: 

Every year we have a huge number of road accidents happening in the US. Thus, it needs a thorough understanding of the circumstances and factors that lead to an accident and the resulting injuries to be able to improve the situation. For this we use the car crash data provided by NHTSA and leverage our data mining skills to analyze the data and suggest a suitable data mining model that can best predict the injury severity of the drivers. 
Further, based on the analysis we will suggest recommendations to avoid severe injuries during accidents.
